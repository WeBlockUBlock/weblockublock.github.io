                        WeBlockU-Block aims to find new ways to prevent uBlock (and any other adblockers) from blocking your promotional material

                    <p class="card-p">
                        Not too long ago did uBlock Origins - a open-source ad and content blocker - add a change that targets and removes "ads" and sponsors from a Project page on Content-sharing sites like Modrinth and Curseforge.
This change was reverted shortly after due to countless false-positives and site-breaking changes, but a better system was introduced.
                    </p>
                    <div class="card-p">
                        On top of this, uBlock's team members have been rude to us, deleting comments of genuine concern or questions from mod devs and calling us mod devs a "moronic team".
                    </div>
                    <p class="card-p">
                        What uBlock does is something most people understand as justified. Blocking actual ads is one thing (Although the ads on Modrinth aren't really intrusive at all), but attempting to block sponsors on a Project page is another.
Modders often times put countless hours into their mods, and that often without getting any monetary compensation in the end. Sponsors are a good way for them to earn something from their hard work, without putting it behind a form of pay- or donation-wall. Blocking these sponsors now means blocking a modders financial help.

                <div class="card">
                    <h2 class="card-h">Maintainers</h2>

                <div class="card">
                    <h2 class="card-h">Sponsor</h2>
                    <p class="card-p">
                        This will be once everything else is done. However, we should add an ad, maybe for Modrinth. Which uses the same system, just to make fun of ad blockers
